# TestGenie
TestGenie is a simple command-line tool that automatically generates JUnit 5 test **stubs** by scanning and analyzing Java source files. 
It uses the JavaParser library to understand code structure. From there, my JavaFileParser and TestGenerator classes handle filtering the nodes and
generating the stub tests.

## Why Use TestGenie / Purpose
Writing test cases can often be skipped or overlooked during fast-paced development or code reviews.
TestGenie solves this by analyzing Java classes and suggesting test case stubs, ensuring test coverage is considered early.

### Key Benefits:

- Reduces the barrier to writing tests by providing a clear starting point.
- Encourages developers to add proper unit tests by generating helpful test scaffolding.
- Keeps test ownership with the developer—you write the logic, TestGenie gives you the structure.

## Requirements
- Java: 22 or earlier (Java 17+ should work without issues)
- Gradle: 7.0 or later
  - You can use the included `./gradlew` wrapper. Hopefully there is no need to install Gradle globally.

Make sure your JAVA_HOME is set correctly and that `./gradlew` is executable in your shell environment.
It should work using the wrapper after in the project after the project is built.

I recommend using the default commands listed in the `How to Run` section, which make use of the Gradle wrapper.

Note: IntelliJ IDEA is likely the easiest IDE to run and debug the project with, but it’s not required.

If you run into any build issues or have trouble running the repository, feel free to reach out.

## How to Run

### 1. Clone and Build
Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/testgenie.git
```
Next, open the project in your favorite editor or cd into the directory from your terminal.

Build the project from the root directory. ex: /TestGenie
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

### 2. Run the Project
You can run the project on the Java source samples in the `/samples/..` folder by running the following command:
```bash
./gradlew run --args="--input samples/BankAccount.java --output output"   
```

DONE! It's that easy! You can view the test classes in the `/output` directory.

Note: You can replace the argument `--input samples/` value with other java files other than BankAccount.
For your convenience:
```bash
./gradlew run --args="--input samples/BankAccount.java --output output"   
```

```bash
./gradlew run --args="--input samples/Calculator.java --output output"   
```

```bash
./gradlew run --args="--input samples/StringUtils.java --output output"   
```

### 3. Review the TestCase Output
For convenience, you can run the **cat** terminal command on the test file like so:
```bash
cat output/CalculatorTest.java
```

Or open them in your editor from the `/output` directory.s

## Features

- Parses any .java file placed in the /samples directory
- Analyzes method bodies, arguments, conditionals, and exceptions
- Generates clean, compilable JUnit 5 tests in the /output directory
- Uses Picocli for CLI parsing—no runtime dependencies required
  
Below is a list of all test scenarios that I generate if they exist in your Java source file:

  | Null checks     | `if (arg == null)` or `Objects.requireNonNull`     |
  |-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
  | Exceptions      | `throw new ...` or `assertThrows(...)`             |
  | Conditionals    | `if`, `switch`                                     |
  | Optional return | `Optional.of`, `Optional.empty()`                  |
  | Boolean return  | `return true/false` or comparison                  |
  | State change    | Non-`final` instance variables, e.g., `balance +=` |

### Flags
You can now control what types of test stubs are generated using the --flag or -f option. Flags should be passed as a comma-separated list. Each flag represents a specific type of test logic.
It is emportant to ensure there are no spaces in the comma seperated list.

Example usage:
```bash
java -jar TestGenie.jar -s src -o tests -f null,conditional
```
This will generate only test stubs related to null checks and conditional branches.

Available flags:

*null* – generates tests for null checks

*conditional* – generates tests for if/else and switch branches

*exception* – generates tests for methods that throw exceptions

*loop* – generates tests for loops like for and while

*state* – generates tests for state changing methods

*booleans* – generates tests for boolean-returning methods

*optionals* – generates tests for Optional-returning methods

You can combine multiple flags to customize the output. If no flags are provided, all available test stubs will be generated by default.

## Entry Point
Most of the logic lives in:

- `src/main/java/com/testgenie/JavaFileParser.java`

- `src/main/java/com/testgenie/TestGenerator.java`

The CLI entry point is:

- `src/main/java/com/testgenie/App.java`

## Final Notes
You can add your own Java files to the /samples directory and run the generator on them.
Test output files are always named using the original class name with a Test suffix (e.g., Calculator → CalculatorTest.java).
